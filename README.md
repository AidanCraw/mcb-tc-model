Abstract

Climate change due to anthropogenic emissions will cause significant damages under even the most optimistic emissions projections. Solar geoengineering has the potential to offset some of these changes by increasing the reflectivity of the planet and thereby reducing the amount of energy reaching the Earth’s surface. However, the risks of solar geoengineering must be thoroughly researched and understood before any solar geoengineering scheme is considered for implementation. Such risks include the possibility of inadvertent weather modification. This study attempts to understand the potential for one such proposed scheme, marine cloud brightening, to affect the tracks of tropical cyclones under projected future climate conditions. Current climate modeling processes for the analysis of the potential impact of marine cloud brightening on tropical cyclone advection either lack the required complexity to properly categorize the proposed relationship or are prohibitively computationally expensive to run. This design project proposes a modeling system to study the relationship between marine cloud brightening and tropical cyclone advection at both a sufficient level of complexity and a relatively low level of computational expense. Using this modeling system, in tandem with the Community Earth Systems Model v 2.1, to investigate changes in tropospheric wind patterns, the effect of marine cloud brightening on tropical cyclones is simulated by reducing the sea surface temperature systematically at a potential cloud seeding site identified in previous literature. The effect of the perturbation on evolution, persistence, strength, and path of tropical cyclones is then quantified.
